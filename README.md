This repository contains a synthetic Passenger Name Record (PNR) dataset simulating international flight bookings across 36 countries in the Schengen region during 2019.

The dataset was generated for research into airline passenger modeling, mobility analysis, and aviation security â€” with full privacy preservation. It supports tasks such as travel pattern analysis, network flow modeling, risk detection research, and synthetic data benchmarking.
